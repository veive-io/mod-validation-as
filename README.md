## **Mod Validation**

### **Overview**

`mod-validation-as` is a foundational library in the Veive protocol, designed to support the creation and integration of validation modules. These modules are essential for verifying the authenticity and authorization of operations within smart accounts on the Koinos blockchain. This library provides the necessary tools and interfaces to develop robust validation logic, ensuring that only valid and authorized operations are executed.

### **Usage and Integration**

#### **Integration in the Veive Protocol**

The `mod-validation-as` library plays a crucial role in the Veive protocol's modular architecture. It integrates closely with the `account-as` module, allowing smart accounts to utilize validation modules to ensure that all operations are properly authorized and adhere to the set rules.

**Flow Integration:**
- The `IModValidation` interface and the `ModValidation` class enable seamless communication and interaction between smart accounts and validation modules. This integration ensures that validation checks are performed whenever an operation is initiated, maintaining the integrity and security of the system.

**Development and Customization:**
- Developers can extend the `ModValidation` class to create custom validation modules tailored to specific use cases, such as checking for multi-signature requirements, enforcing transaction limits, or integrating with external authentication systems.

### **Scripts**

#### **Build**

To compile the package, run:

```bash
yarn build
```
